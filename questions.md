# What is BananaCraft?
BananaCraft is a minecraft client for FPS and Performance, I will not always update tis project.
# How to play BananaCraft?
you will have to download the latest HTML or release. Then, i am planning to make a functional play button to start the game. I will make different releases and versions of this launcher.
# When are BananaCraft updates?
I will make these updates when I feel like I have to. So dont get too excited.
# Can you manually update BananaCraft?
maybe as of right now, no. I will probably make my own website in order for you to MANUALLY update the game/launcher.
# Does BananaCraft have a Launcher?
Yes. This game will have its own fully functional launcher when I think to do so.
